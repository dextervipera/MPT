![plot](figs/Idea_explanation.png)
## What we have to do
- [x] Load data
- [x] try a few ways to align them
- [x] recalculate 
- [ ] visualize, prepare corrected tables as csv in the known format

## Syntax and technical tools used
1. R is used to implement math behind aligment.
2. R source explanation can be found [here](R/readme.md)

# Possible solutions
1. Ignore the offsets and align to the nearest
2. Align by linear interpolation
3. Align by spline
